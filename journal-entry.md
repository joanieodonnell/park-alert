ParkAlert Wireframe Creation Journal Entry - February 23, 2023

https://www.figma.com/file/pAevenGnINYbHiz2NBTvPk/ParkAlert-Wire-Framing?node-id=1-2.

ParkAlert is an application focused on providing real-time, personalized parking alerts to students based on the type and location of the incident. 
The parking alerts incident types include: towing presence, payment enforcement presence, ticketing officer presence, and 
special situation information (game day, construction, etc.) The wireframe was created to visualize the design and layout of the app. 
To create the wireframe, we used Figma, a collaborative design tool that allows team members to work together in real-time. We selected 
appropriate templates and tools and collaborated with team members to create a wireframe that met the requirements. The wireframe includes 
key features such as the main dashboard and search functionality. We also incorporated a map to show available parking spots and 
filters to allow users to customize their search. The wireframe for the ParkAlert app can be accessed at the link provided. 
One of the challenges we encountered during the wireframe creation process was ensuring that the design was user-friendly and intuitive. 
We worked together to test different layouts and design elements to create an app that was easy to use. We received feedback from team members 
and stakeholders on the wireframe and made adjustments based on their input. For example, we added a "favorites" feature to allow users 
to save parking spots for future use.

To create a successful app, we needed to define the app's purpose, target audience, messaging, and design direction. 
Using the Google Docs link provided, we collaborated and created a comprehensive creative brief for the app. 
The creative brief includes an overview of the app's purpose, target audience, key features, and competitive analysis. 
We also included information about the brand personality and tone of voice.

Using UserTesting.com for ParkAlert User Testing - March 19, 2023

UserTesting.com is an online platform that provides user testing services for websites and apps. We decided to use UserTesting.com to 
conduct usability testing for the ParkAlert app as it allowed us to quickly and easily gather feedback from users around the world.
To set up the user testing, we created a test plan that included specific tasks for users to complete and questions to answer. We also 
created a screener to ensure that we recruited participants who matched our target audience. We then submitted our test plan and screener to 
UserTesting.com, and they recruited participants who matched our criteria. We received videos of the participants using the app and answering 
our questions. The feedback we received from UserTesting.com was incredibly valuable. We identified several usability issues that we had not noticed 
before, and we gained insights into how users were interacting with the app.

Screen Completion - March 26, 2023
Today, we continued to make progress on our Park Alert App. After completing the design for the login screen that includes a "continue as guest" option, we moved on to creating the notification preference screen, report view, and homepage with a feed of saved lots. The notification preference screen allows users to choose the types of alerts they want to receive. The homepage includes a feed of saved lots, which allows users to quickly access information about their favorite parks. We've also included buttons and arrows to make it easy for users to navigate between different screens within the app. Our next step is to create the logic that connects all of these screens and buttons together. Overall, we're excited about the progress we've made so far, and we're looking forward to seeing our vision come to life. We're confident that our app will provide park-goers with the tools they need to stay informed and connected.
